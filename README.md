# Remixify

Remixify is a collection of libraries that provides a set of functions to help build better components and themes. It also offers utilities to manage and handle requests in an easy and scalable way.

## Libraries

Remixify currently has two libraries: `@remixify/native` and `@remixify/react-query`.

### @remixify/native

`@remixify/native` provides a set of utilities to help build better components for React Native apps. It includes features such as theming, error handling, and managing API calls.

Check out the [@remixify/native docs](https://github.com/Bryant-Anjos/remixify/tree/main/packages/native#readme) for more detailed information.

### @remixify/react-query

`@remixify/react-query` is like `@remixify/native` but also provides integration with the popular data fetching library React Query. It makes it easy to manage and handle data fetching in React Native apps.
